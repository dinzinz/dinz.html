<h2><b><i>Expirience with universities</i></b></h2>
    <i>College of Saint Petersburg State University of Economics</i></li>
    <p>Unfortunately, my specialization is involved with tourism, I think this isn't relevant</p>
    <p>At least I have specialized secondary education</p>
    <li>Saint-Petersburg State University of Industrial Technologies and Design</li>
    <p>My specialization here was  Automatization of technological processes and management in multi-industry production complexes</p>
    <p>But I took only 1st year. Correspondence training wasn't for me, huh...</p>
    <p>Also I have a chance to go to German by program of Ethnic German repatriates so it'll be nice if someone help me to do it</p>
    <li><i>RSS School</i></li>
    <p>Started in June, let's see where it'll go</p>
